# 🚀 **Quick Ansible Installation Guide**

## **Automated Setup for AWS RHEL 9 EC2 Instance**

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to quickly set up an Ansible Control Node using our automated installation script.

---

## 📋 **Prerequisites**

Before starting, ensure you have:

✅ **AWS EC2 Instance Requirements:**
- **OS:** Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL 9/10) / CentOS 9 / Rocky Linux 9
- **Instance Type:** t2.micro/t3.micro or larger
- **Region:** us-east-1 (recommended)
- **Security Groups:** SSH (port 22) and HTTP (port 80) access
- **Key Pair:** For SSH access

✅ **User Requirements:**
- SSH access to the EC2 instance
- `sudo` privileges on the instance
- Basic familiarity with Linux command line

---

## 🛠️ **Installation Steps**

### **Step 1: Connect to Your EC2 Instance**

Connect to your RHEL 9 EC2 instance via SSH:

```bash
ssh -i your-key.pem ec2-user@your-instance-public-ip
```

**Example:**
```bash
ssh -i ansible-lab-key.pem ec2-user@54.123.45.67
```

---

### **Step 2: Download the Installation Script**

Once connected to your EC2 instance, download the automated installation script:

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibnehussain/ansible_essentials/main/install_ansible.sh
```

**Alternative download method using wget:**
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibnehussain/ansible_essentials/main/install_ansible.sh
```

---

### **Step 3: Make the Script Executable**

Set the proper permissions to make the script executable:

```bash
chmod +x install_ansible.sh
```

---

### **Step 4: Run the Installation Script**

Execute the installation script:

```bash
./install_ansible.sh
```

**What the script will do:**
- ✅ Set hostname to 'Control-Node'
- ✅ Check for system updates
- ✅ Install Python 3 and pip
- ✅ Install AWS CLI and SDKs (boto, boto3)
- ✅ Install Ansible version 8.5.0
- ✅ Install Amazon AWS Ansible collection
- ✅ Install wget utility
- ✅ Create `~/ansible-labs` working directory
- ✅ Download sample playbook
- ✅ Verify all installations

---

### **Step 5: Configure AWS Credentials**

After successful installation, configure your AWS credentials:

```bash
aws configure
```

**Enter your AWS credentials when prompted:**
- **AWS Access Key ID:** Your access key
- **AWS Secret Access Key:** Your secret key  
- **Default region name:** `us-east-1`
- **Default output format:** `json`

---

### **Step 6: Create AWS EC2 Managed Nodes**

Navigate to your working directory and execute the managed nodes creation playbook:

```bash
cd ~/ansible-labs
```

```bash
ansible-playbook create_managed_nodes.yml
```

**What this playbook will do:**
- ✅ Automatically discover your current EC2 configuration
- ✅ Create 2 new EC2 instances (`managed-node-1` and `managed-node-2`)
- ✅ Configure SSH keys for passwordless access
- ✅ Set up hostnames automatically
- ✅ Generate an inventory file (`managed_nodes_inventory`)
- ✅ Display private IP addresses for your reference

**Expected output:**
```
🎉 EC2 Managed Nodes Created Successfully!

📁 Files Created:
- SSH keys: /home/ec2-user/.ssh/id_rsa (private) & id_rsa.pub (public)
- Sample inventory: /home/ec2-user/managed_nodes_inventory

🚀 Ready to start managing your infrastructure with Ansible!
```

---

### **Step 7: Verify Managed Nodes Setup**

After the playbook completes successfully, verify your managed nodes:

#### **Check the generated inventory file:**

```bash
cat ~/managed_nodes_inventory
```

**Example inventory content:**
```ini
[managed_nodes]
node1 ansible_ssh_host=172.31.14.113 ansible_ssh_user=ec2-user
node2 ansible_ssh_host=172.31.2.229 ansible_ssh_user=ec2-user

[webservers]
node1
node2

[all:vars]
ansible_ssh_private_key_file=/home/ec2-user/.ssh/id_rsa
ansible_ssh_common_args='-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no'
```

#### **Verify EC2 instances in AWS Console:**
- Check EC2 Dashboard for 2 new instances
- Names: `managed-node-1` and `managed-node-2`
- Status: Running with public and private IP addresses

---

### **Step 8: Test Your Ansible Setup**

**Test Ansible installation:**
```bash
ansible --version
```

**Test connectivity to managed nodes using the generated inventory:**
```bash
ansible all -m ping -i ~/managed_nodes_inventory
```

**Expected successful output:**
```
node1 | SUCCESS => {
    "ansible_facts": {
        "discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/bin/python3"
    },
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
node2 | SUCCESS => {
    "ansible_facts": {
        "discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/bin/python3"
    },
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
```

**Alternative: Test specific groups:**
```bash
ansible managed_nodes -m ping -i ~/managed_nodes_inventory
ansible webservers -m ping -i ~/managed_nodes_inventory
```

**Run a quick command on all managed nodes:**
```bash
ansible all -m shell -a "hostname" -i ~/managed_nodes_inventory
```
